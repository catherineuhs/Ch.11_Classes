'''
Open an arcade window that is 500 x 300 pixels and named 1000 Circles.
Create a class called Circle.
Initialize the x and y positions to be somewhere in the window.
Initialize the radius to be 10 pixels.
Initialize the color to randomized 0-255 RGB color format.
Add a method to the Circle Class called draw_circle and draw the circle.
In the main program, use a for loop to call the Circle class and draw it 1000 times.
Feel free to see what happens if you draw it 10,000 times as well.
